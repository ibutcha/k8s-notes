 - **kubectl**  is the Kubernetes `command-line tool` that allows you to run commands against `Kubernetes clusters`. You can use kubectl to `deploy applications`, `inspect`, `manage cluster resource`s, and `view logs`.
 
   Common commands:
    - kubectl version --client
    - kubectl get nodes
 
 - **Minikube** is a `tool` that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a **single-node Kubernetes cluster** inside a Virtual Machine (VM), docker, etc. on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.
